# TensorPedia
an encyclopedia of deep learning operators

# Features

TensorPedia is a website for learning deep neural network operators. It contains comprehensive information about deep network operators, including their inputs, outputs, examples, mathematical formulas, and interactive details.
The primary categorization of operators is based on their types, including convolution, linear, activation, pooling, normalization, and others.
The secondary categorization is based on operator subtypes. For example, activation operators include Relu, Sigmoid, and Tanh operators.

For each operator, you can view its mathematical formulas, input and output tensor shapes, internal parameters, and interactive details.
